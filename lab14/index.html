    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>In this lab, we focused on reviewing and debugging past assignments. We used browser developer tools, the JavaScript console, and our own logic to identify and fix errors in older labs.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>When looking back at my old lab lab 9 I could not get the css to work. When looking at the code I realized that my css code was not linked correctly. I used console log to try and figure out why the code wasnt runng but still wasnt able to get it done :D. But the website look pretty so thats what matters really. </p>
