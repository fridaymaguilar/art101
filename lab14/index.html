    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>In this lab, we focused on reviewing and debugging past assignments. We used browser developer tools, the JavaScript console, and our own logic to identify and fix errors in older labs.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>Some common problems we ran into included typos in JavaScript, missing semicolons, incorrect function logic, and unlinked scripts or stylesheets. We also had to deal with scope issues and some syntax errors.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>After debugging, the old labs are now working as expected. We added comments to explain our code better and used proper formatting to make everything neat and readable.</p>

    <p><strong>Lab 7:</strong> The main issue was a missing link to the JavaScript file. After fixing the file path and rechecking the file name, the code worked perfectly.</p>

    <p><strong>Lab 10:</strong> There was an error in the loop logic. We corrected the loop conditions and now the output behaves as intended.</p>
